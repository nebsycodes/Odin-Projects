    <p>You are working at a school; currently your students are studying the planets of our solar system, and you want to provide them with an easy-to-follow set of data to look up facts and figures about the planets. An HTML data table would be ideal â€” you need to take the raw data you have available and turn it into a table, following the steps below.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Jupiter</td>
            <td>Mars</td>

            <td>Uranus</td>
            <td>Pluto</td>
